# flutter-freezed

Boost ðŸš€ your development of Dart/Flutter apps using a GraphQL API by generating models directly
from your GraphQL Schema.

Currently, this plugin only generates [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) models, but work
is ongoing to make it way easier to work with GraphQL by scaffolding an entire GraphQL client with
support for Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions taking huge inspiration from
[KitQL](https://www.kitql.dev/)

## TL;DR

The `flutter-freezed` plugin generates [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) models from a
GraphQL Schema.
